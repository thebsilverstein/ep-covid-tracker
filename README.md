# El Paso, Texas COVID-19 Tracker

The [El Paso, Texas COVID-19 Tracker](https://elpasocovid19tracker.com) is a website I built in March 2020. My goal was to build a simple, no-nonsense website to report COVID-19 statistics and trends for the City of El Paso. I gave myself a few hours to design, program, and launch the website.

I started with a [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) application serving a "static" dashboard page. The index action in the dashboard controller generates the content displayed on the dashboard. My plan was to eventually put the daily data into a database and integrate a content management system, which is why I chose Ruby on Rails. I never completed my plan, because I didn't need to. It only takes me a few minutes to manually push updates the website.

There are **way better** ways to structure this application using Ruby on Rails. I could have used [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) instead. But I got the job done! The website has over 165,000 visitors and over 1,000,000 page views since launch.
